## Tying UIEvent enums to menustates

each UIEvent enum refers to a button you can press on the UI. this means that each button and therefore event should correspond to a possible state you can access.

The exception, being, of course, a loading state.



### OOP Research and whatnot

It looks like I might have to up the research and paperwork i've done to present my work in a reasonable way. A short video might help with illustrations and/or a powerpoint, though making it interesting would be important. In this case, a video allows for more control.



Use of external library can be serialisation and deserialization using NewtonSoft.JSON.



### The project scope

Research project on implementation of the midpoint displacement algorithm and then a little bit of state machines and the general design of games.

Also focus on the dependency inversion principle with solid examples in artillery

Then the design of artillery with a focus on patterns (abstract factory, composite, command/command stream, states, and some other things I guess. this will have to be a big focus) -- On the *design* of OO programs.



Implementation and how A3 was fully implementated



General scope of other possible projects to pursue (A3X full rewrite, Hatsuyuki)



Compiling everything into a research report, i guess. I might have to consult Medhi but definitely Chris.

Research implies data, and writing. Guess I'll have to do both. Data I can collect:

- Performance numbers based on killing entities after they've exited the screen
- Performance numbers from using a static list instead of a dynamic one (this was really interesting)
- Midpoint displacement algorithm implementation and how this affected the design of the program **this seems promising**
- Model-view-controller paradigm for A3X and A3Rx
