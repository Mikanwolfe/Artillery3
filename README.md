**Artillery 3** is a 2D physics-based shooter where players take turns controlling vehicles on a map of of varying elevation. Players will be able to move their *artillery pieces* across the map and fire in large arcs towards enemy players, with the explicit goal of desytroying all other players.

Artillery 3 is a complete re-write of the original Artillery 2 project found [here](https://github.com/Mikanwolfe/artillery). 

**Features:**

* Mulitple vehicles (now *Characters* or *Mobiles*) with **art!!!**
* Improved projectile physics (projectiles have different dynamics such as lift)
* Fractal Terrain generation using the Midpoint Displacement Algorithm
* Destructable terrain!
* Aiming help (finally)
* Improved graphics and possibly animations! (Terrain textures and character animations)
* Scenes and proper menu Game States
* Saving character stats
* Multiplayer networking support, possibly.

The terrain in Artillery 3 will be generated based on various algorithms using the *strategy* design pattern. Vehicle dynamics will be incoporated using the *composite* design pattern and the UI will embody various themes using the *Factory* design patten.

**Roadmap:**

* [ ] Multiplayer Support (Local)
* [ ] Multiplayer Support (Network)
* [ ] Strategy Design Pattern
  * [ ] Random terrain generation
  * [ ] Algorithmic terrain generation
* [ ] Realistic Physics
* [ ] Wind
* [ ] Multiple Vehicles
  * [ ] Vehicle statistics
    * [ ] Restricted firing angles
    * [ ] Restricted firing power
* [ ] NPC/AI/""CPU"" enemies
